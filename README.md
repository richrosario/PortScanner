### PortScanner

I'm refreshing my Python skills with a focus on Security/Network related projects.

* Simple Python tool to check if ports are open or closed
* Part of the Network Programming with Python Course on freeCodeCamp.org -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdiSJakIS4

### Executing program

* Port scanning is illegal; Keep this local.
